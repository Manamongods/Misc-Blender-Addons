Some miscellaneous Blender Addons I've made

blender_unity_fixer renames spaces and special characters to _ so that a .blend file imported into unity with Blender 2.79 with ascii fbx files will import the same when using blender 2.8 to import binary fbx files.

shift_curve cycles the order of the points in a path curve

viewport_material_transfer transfers viewport colors to have the same colors in eevee lookdev mode
